# Nitrogen-levels-VA-Streams
ENGR_265  Final project analysing VA USGS water data to look for patterns in Nitrogen Data

This code was written to evaluate USGS water data to see how high Nitrogen levels are in Virgina stream as well as how they 
have change over time and how they relate to other water quality metrics

This program required Daily data sets from the 10 USGS monitoring locations in VA that track nitrogen levels in water.
I realized only 5 of these locations actually had compiled the nitrogen level data into downloadable files.
I aslo learned that the locations only had downloadable files for annual discharge and it was daily data only on nitrogen levels so I would have to work with that and evaluate nitrogen level changes over days instead of years.


A tutorial/walkthrough of how to operate the code
A sample of results from the analysis
Any limitations on running the program
A brief discussion of future results.
